# doctr: an R package to help check data consistency

The goal of this package is automating as much as possible the task of
verifying if everything is ok with a dataset. Like a real doctor, it has
functions for examining, diagnosing and assessing it's "patients'"
progress over time.

You can download `doctr` by running

```r
devtools::install_github("ctlente/doctr")
```

### Basic usage

To create an automated exploratory report, run `examine()` paired with
one of the `report_*()` functions. For more information about the reports
generated and their different types, run `vignette("doctr_examine")`.

```r
# Creating an automated exploratory report of X's numeric variables
report <- X %>% examine() %>% report_num()
```

To verify if the columns of a table pass certain standards and fit
certain assumptions, use the `diagnose()` function. By default, this
function runs the exams generated by `guess_exams()`, but you can
also run it by yourself, edit the exams and pass them as an argument.
For more information about this process, run `vignette("doctr_diagnose")`.

```r
# Checking if each of X's variables can be assigned to a prototype
diagnostic <- X %>% diagnose() %>% issues()
```

To compara a table with another one (specially if it's only one table
that has evolved in a certain time frame), use `compare()`. Just as with
`diagnose()`, this function outputs human readable results via the `issues()`
auxiliary function. For more information on table comparisons, run
`vignette("doctr_compare")`.

```r
# Checking if X_jan and X_feb can be considered similar tables
comparison <- X_jan %>% compare(X_feb) %>% issues()
```
